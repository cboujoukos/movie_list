# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Movie.create([{ title: 'Star Wars' }, { title: 'Lord of the Rings' }, {title: 'Deadpool'}])
List.create([{name: 'List 1'}, {name: 'List 2'}])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
